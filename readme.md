## 🧩 How Dynamic Includes Work

The site uses `js/include.js` to dynamically insert reusable HTML components (like navbar, footer, about section) into your main `index.html`. This keeps your markup DRY and easy to maintain.

**Example:**
```html
<!-- In index.html -->
<div include-html="include/navbar.html"></div>
```
The `include.js` script automatically replaces this with the content of `navbar.html`.

---

## 🌟 Customization Guide

- **Add your projects:** Edit `include/projects.html` to add or update project cards.
- **Update skills:** Modify `include/skills.html` to reflect your expertise.
- **Profile image:** Replace `img/my_image.jpg` with your own picture.
- **Resume:** Swap in your own PDF in `docs/resume.pdf`.
- **Styling:** Adjust or extend CSS in the `css/` folder.

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Simplicity:** Clean, uncluttered layouts
- **Modularity:** Reusable HTML/CSS components
- **Accessibility:** Semantic markup and alt text for images
- **Performance:** Minimal JS, optimized images, fast loads
